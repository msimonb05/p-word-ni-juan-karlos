# P-word ni Juan Karlos

Hi, Mark here.
I only placed this **AS A JOKE** HAHAHAHAHA!

I do not consider this as an actual project, more like a sh!tpose, a "sh!tcommit" even.
However, this is a simple web project that uses plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Apparently, I am using Node.js, because that was the initial server environment that was recommended to me by the Internet. I only used Node.js in order for Javascript to work on my VS Code.

With that said, thank you for looking at this!
I do not really know what to place in here, **yet**, because I have yet to learn more.
